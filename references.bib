You will learn how to combine the power of OpenGL, the most widely adopted cross-platform API for GPU programming, with the accessibility and versatility of the Python programming language. Topics you will explore include generating geometric shapes, transforming objects with matrices, applying image-based textures to surfaces, and lighting your scene. Advanced sections explain how to implement procedurally generated textures, postprocessing effects, and shadow mapping. In addition to the sophisticated graphics framework you will develop throughout this book, with the foundational knowledge you will gain, you will be able to adapt and extend the framework to achieve even more spectacular graphical results.},

What these computer vision interfaces have in common is low cost, and ease of implementatio n, as they require means which are commonly available today to most individuals/institutions, such as computers and small cameras. They have the additional advantage that they do not require special calibration procedures, they do not limit body movements with cables or tethers, nor do they require wearing special suites with markers for tracking.},

	abstract = {The study presented here applies from an interdisciplinary perspective the ?temporal know-how? of art and communication design as well as the social sciences to the exploration of the impact of two types of holistic artistic waiting room transformations on waiting experience and behaviour. The quasi-experiment was conducted in a hospital and in an administrative setting. Contrary to current information centred types of waiting management stressing ?clock-time? only and attempting to reduce objective waiting times, the artistic intervention follows a holistic concept by appealing to all the senses influencing felt time and social time. It comprises visual, acoustic, tactile/haptic and olfactory elements (fragrance management). The ?observation-oriented? artistic intervention uses contemplative video works, ornamentation, relaxing fragrances and a corresponding seating design. The ?action-oriented? room climate promotes communication and stimulating object and surface design, coupled with a subliminally stimulating fragrance environment. After a simultaneous one-week baseline measurement in both organizations, follow-up measures were conducted during one week of each type of intervention. Results are based on 482 personal interviews and 1950 observations of waiting clients: Perceived waiting time and objective waiting time correlated only moderately (rp?=?56) and expected waiting time was overestimated. In both waiting room settings, room transformations ? compared to baseline measures ? reduced waiting stress behaviour (however not perceived stress) and increased both positive overall room perception and the evaluation of specific room characteristics among clients/patients. Differences between the two room climates were not significant and effects appear to be stronger in the administrative space. The relatively short waiting times (16?20?min) and high levels of waiting satisfaction at baseline might have limited the effect size of the holistic interventions. At the same time observed positive outcomes can be plausibly expected in waiting zones with much longer waiting times.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To design an innovative interactive media display in a pediatric hospital clinic waiting space that addresses the growing demand for accessible, contact-surface-free options for play.BACKGROUND:In healthcare settings, waiting can be anxiety provoking for children and their accompanying family members. Opportunities for positive distraction have been shown to reduce waiting anxiety, leading to positive health outcomes.METHODS:An interactive media display, ScreenPlay, was created and evaluated using a participatory design approach and a combination of techniques including quality function deployment and mixed data elicitation methods (questionnaires, focus groups, and observations). The user and organizational design requirements were established and used to review contemporary strategies for positive distraction in healthcare waiting spaces and to conceptualize and test ScreenPlay. Ten staff members, 11 children/youths, and 6 parents participated in the design and evaluation of ScreenPlay.RESULTS:ScreenPlay provided a positive, engaging experience without the use of contact surfaces through which infections can be spread. It was accessible to children, youth, and adults of all motor abilities. All participants strongly agreed that the interactive media display would improve the healthcare waiting experience.CONCLUSIONS:ScreenPlay is an interactive display that is the result of a successful model for the design of healthcare waiting spaces that is collaborative, interdisciplinary, and responsive to the needs of its community.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a preliminary framework to inform the analysis and design of tangible narratives. Researchers and designers have been using tangible user interfaces (TUIs) for storytelling over the past two decades, but to date no comprehensive analysis of these systems exists. We argue that storytelling systems that use digitally-enhanced physical objects form a unique medium with identifiable narrative characteristics. Our framework isolates these characteristics and focuses on the user's perspective to identify commonalities between existing systems, as well as gaps that can be addressed by new systems. We find that the majority of systems in our sample require the user to perform exploratory actions from an external narrative position. We note that systems that cast the user in other interactive roles are rare but technologically feasible, suggesting that there are many underexplored possibilities for tangible storytelling.},

This means we still know little about how these new interfaces perform in real life settings and how users appropriate them. This paper presents findings from a field study of an existing interactive table in a museum of natural history. Visitors were found to employ a wide variety of gestures for interacting; different interface elements invited different types of gesture. The analysis highlights challenges and design conflicts in the design of tabletop interfaces for public settings, such as latency times and side-effects of ‘frame-less’ content, which had some users struggling to learn how to interact. While the majority of visitors engaged at least briefly with the table, which enabled browsing question-answer text about animal species, talk amongst visitors dealt mainly with how to interact and evoked few comments, indicating shallow engagement with content.},

In this article we discuss the important software engineering issues that appear in one of the new media art subfields, namely interactive installation art. Our deductions and suggestions are based mainly on reports available in the literature (i.e. published papers). Interactive installation art is often heavily dependent on software and thus software engineering issues are important to consider. Software requirements, which are vague and frequently changeable, appear to be one of the major and most difficult issues to be considered in the development of interactive installation. Timely evaluation, validation and testing with potential users are helpful for successful completion of the artwork Special attention should be paid to the choice of process model and software architecture to allow flexibility. The final goal is to provide a road map for artists who need software engineering skills to communicate with software engineers and/or to act themselves as programmers or software engineers of their artworks. Additionally, software engineers who start working with interactive installation art will profit from this summary of relevant reports.},

	abstract = {Improving game design is a hard task. Few methods are available in games user research (GUR) to test formally how game designs work for players. In particular, the usefulness of user tests (UTs) for game designers has not been fully studied in the CHI community. We propose a novel GUR method called Biometric Storyboards (BioSt) and present a study demonstrating how a Classic UT and a BioSt UT both help designers create a better gameplay experience. In addition, we show that BioSt can help designers deliver significantly better visuals, more fun, and higher gameplay quality than designing without UTs and that classic UTs do not provide this significant advantage. Our interviews support the idea that BioSt provides more nuanced game design improvement. The design implication is that a game designed with the BioSt method will result in high gameplay quality.},
